LinearSearch and BinarySearch

Question :
Given an Array and its length and a key element, return the index (Where key is found) if key is found in array
or -1 if key is not found.

Sample Input : 
[1,2,3,4,5] Key : 4, Returns 3
[0,49,22] Key : 212, Returns -1

Observations: (Write down what you observed here, Run for various variations):

Linear Search:

Binary Search :

Conclusion :
*/

int linearSearch(int *arr, int len, int key) {

	return -1;
}



int binarySearch(int *arr, int len, int key) {
	//Use this function as wrapper function,if you are implementing bs recursively.
	return -1;
}
